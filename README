# Solemate

Solemate is a concept ecommerce landing page focused on premium footwear. It is built as a static site with semantic HTML and modular CSS so it can be extended into a full storefront later on.

## Features
- Promotional announcement bar with dismiss button markup ready for future interactivity
- Responsive hero section that highlights the core value proposition and metrics
- Brand carousel strip showcasing partner logos
- Reusable product grid for new arrivals and top-selling collections
- Secondary showcase layout for curated drops

## Project Structure
- `index.html` &mdash; main landing page markup
- `css/global.css` &mdash; typography tokens, layout primitives, shared components
- `css/homepage.css` &mdash; homepage-specific sections and responsive tweaks
- `assets/` &mdash; fonts, icons, and imagery referenced by the site
- `script.js` &mdash; placeholder for future behavior (e.g., promo dismissal)

## Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve the project with any static file server:
   - Python: `python -m http.server`
   - Node: `npx serve`
2. Update any missing imagery in `assets/images` to match the placeholders referenced in the markup.
3. Customize copy, product details, and brand assets to align with your brand.

## Responsiveness
The layout adapts from a multi-column desktop view down to a single-column mobile experience. Key breakpoints are defined at 992px, 768px, and 600px for tablets and handheld devices.

## Next Steps
- Wire up `script.js` to add promo bar dismissal and other UI behaviors
- Add additional pages (Shop, On Sale, New Arrivals, Brands) and link them to the navigation
- Integrate a CMS or headless commerce backend to populate product data dynamically
